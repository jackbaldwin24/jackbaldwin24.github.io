            <p>I have a strong background in various technologies and frameworks, including JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and C#. I enjoy tackling complex problems and delivering innovative solutions. My time at Epic has honed my skills in software engineering and allowed me to work on impactful projects in the healthcare industry.</p>
